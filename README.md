_Full text search_ is the core app of a full-text search framework for your Nextcloud. 
To have it operate, and get content indexed, some other apps are needed: 

- Some **Providers Apps** to extract content from your Nextcloud. 
- A **Platform App** that communicate with a search platform _(ie. Elastic Search, Solr, â€¦)_ in order to index the content provided by the **Providers**.   
_Note: There is no limit to the number of platform-apps that can be installed, however only one can be selected from the admin interface_
